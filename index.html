                <p>Roy Choi’s excellent version of the clichéd dish has a surprise ingredient: lemon-lime soda. He uses it as a substitute for sugar. “Asian cooking folklore says that adding soda to a marinade will help tenderize meat and poultry,” says Choi. “As a chef, I know it probably does nothing. But because I want to carry on historical cooking traditions, I continue to use sodas in my marinades.”</p>
